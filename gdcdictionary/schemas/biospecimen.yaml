description: >
  Any material sample taken from a biological entity for testing, diagnostic, propagation, treatment
  or research purposes, including a sample obtained from a living organism or taken from the
  biological object after halting of all its life functions. Biospecimen can contain one or more
  components including but not limited to cellular molecules, cells, tissues, organs, body fluids,
  embryos, and body excretory products. In the subject of contrived samples, it describes any material
  obtained from a normal donor. Link this record to the followup node in order to record patient
  context variables related to blood draws or biospecimen collection.
