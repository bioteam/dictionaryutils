description: >
  A visit by a patient or study participant to a medical professional. A clinical encounter that
  encompasses planned and unplanned trial interventions, procedures and assessments that may be
  performed on a subject. A visit has a start and an end, each described with a rule. The process
  by which information about the health status of an individual is obtained before and after a study
  has officially closed; an activity that continues something that has already begun or that repeats
  something that has already been done.
